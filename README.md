# GYMIND – Smart Fitness Intelligence Platform
## Overview

GYMIND is a dual-platform smart gym ecosystem designed to connect gym users with partnered gyms through real-time location-based discovery, traffic monitoring, and personalized fitness insights.

The platform aims to solve common problems in the fitness industry such as overcrowding, lack of transparency in gym activity, low member engagement, and the absence of data-driven decision making for gym owners.

GYMIND consists of:
- A mobile application for gym users
- A web application for gym administrators and system administrators

The long-term vision is to evolve GYMIND into an AI-powered fitness and location intelligence platform for gyms and users in Lebanon and the region.
